        <h1>This week's favorite: The Golden Retriever</h1>
        <small>By: Michael Z.E.</small>
        <p>
          Golden Retriever dog, breed of sporting dog developed in Scotland in
          the 19th century as a gundog and water retriever to assist hunters in
          recovering game birds. Typically a strong and hardy all-around dog and
          an excellent swimmer, it stands 21.5 to 24 inches (55 to 61 cm) at the
          withers and weighs 55 to 75 pounds (25 to 34 kg). Its thick coat is
          long on the neck, thighs, tail, and back of the legs and may be any
          shade of golden brown. The Golden Retriever was first shown in England
          in 1908 and was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1925.
          Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular dog breeds in the United
          States. The breed is noted for being friendly, gentle, and willing to
          work, and it makes an excellent family pet. Golden Retrievers also
          have been trained as guide dogs for the blind. <br />
          But many do not know his real name:

        <h3>Canis lupus familiaris</h3>

        <p>
          Golden Retrievers are a generally healthy breed; they have an average
          lifespan of 12 to 13 years.Irresponsible breeding to meet high demand
          has led to the prevalence of inherited health problems in some breed
          lines, including allergic skin conditions, eye problems and sometimes
          snappiness. These problems are rarely encountered in dogs bred from
          responsible breeders. <br />
          The breed is unusually prone to cancer, with one United States study
          finding cancer to be the cause of death in approximately 50% of the
          population, the second highest in the study. Several European studies
          found a much lower prevalence (20-39%), which may reflect the
          significant genetic divergence between the American and European
          populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosaroma and lymphoma,
          with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the for the former
          and one in eight for the former. The high prevalence of cancer deaths
          among Golden retrievers may partly represent a lack of other
          congenital diseases.
